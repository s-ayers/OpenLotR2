Step 1: Place the game CD in your CD-ROM drive. If the Windows 95 AutoPlay feature is enabled, a window will appear automatically on your screen.

From the window that appears, double click on the Setup icon. Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation. The install program will give you several options.

Part 1

MS-DOS Installation
===================

This game cannot be installed and run from Windows 3.1. If you have Windows 3.1, you must exit to DOS in order to install and play this game. Step 1: Exit to the MS-DOS prompt in order to install the game. The MS-DOS prompt should look something like this C:>or this C:\>( the letter may be different if you are using a different drive). You must exit completely out of any other programs you may have running, such as Windows or Dosshell. Step 2: Insert the CD into your CD-ROM drive. Step 3: Access your CD-ROM drive by typing in the letter designation of the drive, followed by a colon, and then pressing the <Enter> key. If your CDROM drive is your D drive, for example, type:
D: and then press <Enter>. At the drive prompt, type  
INSTALL and then press <Enter>. Follow the onscreen instructions. By default, the installation program will create a directory on your hard drive called LORDS2, and place all necessary game files in that directory. To load the game after you have installed it, access the directory that holds the game files by typing:
CD\LORDS2 and then pressing the <Enter> key. (If you have installed the game to a different directory, access that one instead.) To run the game, type:
LORDS 2 and press <Enter>. 9
Getting Started
LORDS OF THE REALM II has an intuitive interface designed to allow you to begin playing quickly and easily. After you install and load the game, we recommend that you consult the LORDS II Getting Started card. This will familiarize you with some of the games basic concepts, and allow you to begin managing your first county. Do not expect to master the game right away. Use your first few games to experiment with different settings and strategies, and consult this manual or the games on-line help when you have specific questions. The game includes several instruction screens that will appear automatically and will help you with the games objectives and controls. When this manual or the on-line instructions tell you to click on something, click on it with the left mouse button unless specifically instructed to use the right mouse button. In general, left-clicking on an item performs an action or calls up a panel in which you can perform an action. Right-clicking on an item either calls up a panel that gives general information about the item, or exits a panel or screen without taking any action.

Help
If you have any questions, or if you come across something you do not understand, help is available in several forms. As you play, instructions will appear automatically on your screen. (You may turn these off by clicking on Tip Screens under the Game Help menu). There are also Tool Tips which explain many of the games buttons and icons. These Tool Tips appear on the screen when you hold your mouse pointer over a button or feature for a moment. (You may turn the balloon help off by clicking on Tool Tips under the Game Help menu). For more detailed information, consult either this manual, or the on-line help. Online help is available under the Help menu.
