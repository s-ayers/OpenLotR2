The Realm 
*****

When the game begins, your screen will display a view of the realm and many of its features.  The country is divided up into independent counties. At the start of the game each player controls a single county. County borders are marked by stone walls. Mountains, woods, and roads also appear on the main map.

At the start of the game, there are two types of counties: those controlled by nobles, and those that are independent. Counties controlled by nobles appear in the nobles color on the mini map in the upper right corner of the screen. In a multiplayer game, a noble may represent either a human or a computer player.

The social center of each county is its county town. The county town will begin as a small settlement with a colored flag indicating its noble (if it has one). As its population grows, the town will fill up with buildings. You will be able to get some sense of a countys progress by looking at its county town. 

As a population grows, villages will also appear outside of the county town.

Each county also has several other features. Rightclicking on the features on the map will display information about them.  

Every county will have a blacksmith shop, several fields, and usually one or more industrial sites like lumber mills, quarries,  or iron mines. In custom games, you will be able to set many of the conditions of the starting counties. 

Your county and its resources will be the foundation upon which you will build your kingdom.

The Main Map
============

The main map is where most of the game action takes place. It shows a zoomed-in view of the realm that displays the essential details of each county: towns, castles, industries, forests, mountains, fields, roads, borders. The main map shows only a portion of the entire realm. To move your view, scroll around by placing your mouse pointer just over any edge of your computer screen.

Your main map view will always determine the selected county. The control panel will always display information and control settings relevant to the selectedcounty. If you adjust the labor allocation slider bar, for example, you are managing labor for the selected county only.

The selected county is always the county in the center of your main map view. It is indicated on the mini map by a white highlight around its border. Watch the county selection change as you scroll around the realm.

The main map also shows merchant wagons and county-to-county transport wagons, as well as the armies of the various players. 

The control panel to the right of the main map is where you oversee and manage your counties and access other game screens. For more information on the panel, see County Management (page 24).
