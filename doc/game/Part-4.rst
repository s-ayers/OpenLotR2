Armies
######
No ruler can wear the crown without first building,
organizing, and commanding powerful armies.
You may create many armies in the course of a game.
Each army is composed of various types of soldiers,
armed with weapons you buy or produce, and each
may travel independently of one another, to fight and
conquer as you command.
There are two main classes of soldiery in LORDS II:
citizen solders and mercenaries. Mercenaries are soldiers
for hire, who travel the land and fight for
whomever will pay them. They tend to be skilled professionals
but they are costly to hire and maintain.
You may find yourself unable to afford them until
after you have ruled for several years.
A citizen army, on the other hand, comes from the
ranks of the people themselves. The cheapest kind of
soldier is the simple peasant soldier, armed only with
whatever weapon he can find on the farm. Or you
may arm your citizen soldiers with swords, pikes, and
other weapons which will improve their performance
considerably.
You raise a citizen army through conscription
(forcible service). Conscripting peasants can reduce
happiness: your people realize it is necessary, but they
will become angry if you conscript too many.
Mercenaries will come to your county occasionally to
offer their services, and you may hire them when you
can afford them.

Creating an Army
****************


Drafting Citizens
=================
To create an army, click on the Create an Army button
on the control panel. The armory will appear. The
panel in the middle of the armory contains a slider bar
which you may use to choose the number of citizens
you want to draft into your next army.

The slider bar shifts your population between civilian
service and conscription into the army you are about
to raise.

Once part of an army, citizens cease to be counted
among your population. Only those not conscripted
will be available for the non-military work pool of
agricultural and industrial labor.

The slider bar is your way of determining what proportion
of the population you will conscript (the
numbers on either side of the bar will equal your current
population). Slide the figure toward the soldier
to raise conscription; slide it toward the farmer to
lower it.
Just moving the bar does not actually conscript anyone,
it just sets the percentage of people you will conscript.
Once you have determined the size of the
army you want to conscript, click on Continue.
The conscription panel also displays:
 The change in happiness resulting from the conscription
level you set. The higher the percentage,
the lower your happiness will fall. You may not
conscript a number that will cause happiness to
drop below zerobeyond a certain point, peasants
will simply refuse to take up arms!
 The number of mercenaries (if any) in the county,
and the hiring price they demand. If you do not
have sufficient gold in your treasury to hire them,
the panel will tell you so.
 The number of each type of weapon currently in
your armory. If you have 20 swords, the army may
not include more than 20 swordsmen.
Clicking on the Continue button confirms the size of
the army you are raising. You may then determine the
makeup of the army by arming your soldiers.


Arming your Soldiers
====================
After you have determined the portion of your population
to conscript, you may arm your soldiers with
swords, pikes, and other weapons.
An army must have at least 50 soldiers in it. It may
include a mix of several types of soldier: peasant soldiers,
macemen, pikemen, archers, crossbowmen,
swordsmen, and knights. To raise non-peasant soldiers,
your armory must contain weapons.
The figures at the bottom of the screen (and the
weapons visible in the armory) show the types of soldiers
you may raise. The weapons you possess hang
on the armory wall. If swords are visible, you may
raise swordsmen; if pikes are visible, you may raise
pikemen, and so on. The number next to each figure
shows the number of that type of soldier currently in
the army.

To arm your soldiers, click on the figures at the bottom
of the screen (or click directly on the weapons in
the armory). A panel will appear, telling you the number
of the selected soldier currently in the army, and
the maximum number you may raise. Use the up and
down arrows to set the desired number, and then
click on the corner arrow to close the panel. The
number you have set will appear next to the corresponding
figure at the bottom of the armory screen.
When you approve of the army composition shown
at the bottom of the armory screen, click on the
Create button to create the army.
If you are unsatisfied with the size or composition of
your army and wish to start over, click on the Change
button to return to the conscription slider bar.
If you change your mind and decide not to create an
army at all, click on the Cancel button (or right click)
to return to the main map.

Army Wages
==========
Your citizens soldiers demand wages. If you do not
pay your army wages, your soldiers will desert and
you will lose them. You may consult your Treasury at
any time to see the total army wages you must pay
each season.
To see the wages of any specific army, right click on
that army on the main map.



Hiring Mercenaries
==================
Mercenaries are soldiers of fortune who travel from county to county
offering their services to any lord who will pay their wages.

Mercenaries are skilled warriors and as such they can be expensive. They come
with their own weapons, though, and hiring them will not reduce a county's 
happiness or population like conscription does. When you see a mercenary icon
on top of one of your county towns on the main map, a mercenary army is present
in your county.

When there is a mercenary army in your county you may find out more about it by
going to the armory. The panel in the middle of the screen displays the number
and type of the mercenaries, what it will cost to hire them, and their seasonal
wages.

If you have enough crowns to hire the mercenaries, the panel will ask you
whether or not you wish to hire them. If you click on Yes, the mercenaries will
be added to the corresponding unit type in the stone panel at the bottom of the
screen. Their wages will be deducted automatically from your treasury, and will
continue to be deducted for every season you employ them.

You may not combine two armies that both contain mercenaries. Most mercenary
clans have fought against each other in the past, and as a result they do not
get along!

Troop Types
===========
Peasant Soldiers
----------------
Peasant soldiers are the most basic, most ill-equipped troop type in an army,
but they can be useful. Peasants soldiers carry only their own pitchforks as
weapons, so they cost no crowns to raise and arm.

Peasants can move at medium speed around the battlefield, and they have a
minimal ability to attack and defend. They wear no armor, so they are more
vulnerable to ranged attacks by bow and crossbow than units wearing armor.

Macemen
-------
Macemen carry large and heavy warclubs with spiked
heads. Macemen wear light armor and can move
quickly across the battlefield (second only to knights
in speed). Cheaper and faster than swordsmen, macemen
are good attackers but weak defenders and are
vulnerable to ranged attacks. Mace production
requires both iron and wood.

Macemen are ideal for chasing down archers and
crossbowmen. They are also very effective against
peasants.

Pikemen
-------
Because of their heavy and cumbersome weapons,
pikemen move very slowly on the field. Their light
mail protects them somewhat from ranged attacks.
Their hand-to-hand attack value is less than that of
macemen, swordsmen, and knights, but their handto-
hand defense value is relatively high. Pikes are less
expensive than crossbows, swords, and knights
equipment, but a bit more expensive than maces. Pike
production requires iron and wood.

Pikemen are best used to defend archers and crossbowmen.


Archers
-------
Archers and crossbowmen are the only units capable of ranged attacks. Archers
wear no armor and are moderately fast on the field. They are not well suited to
hand-to-hand combat, as their real value is in the ranged attack. Archers have
a greater range than crossbowmen, and they can fire more rapidly. Each shot
from an archer's longbow, however, is not as powerful as one from a crossbow.
Bow production requires no iron, but quite a bit of wood.

Archers are not well suited for attacking units that wear armor. They are very
effective against peasants, macemen, and archers. Against swordsmen and 
knights, archers are nearly useless.

Crossbowmen
-----------
Unlike archers, crossbowmen wear light armor. As a result they will better
withstand ranged attacks. Crossbowmen are poor hand-to-hand combatants but they
have better close range defensive ability than archers. Shots from a crossbow
will do more damage than those from a longbow, but crossbowmen take a longer
time to reload, so their rate of fire is lower. Crossbows are among the more
expensive weapons to purchase or produce. Crossbow production requires both
wood and iron.

Crossbows are very effective against units wearing armor. (Against peasants or
macemen, archers are a better value.) Crossbowmen can also be very effective
against siege weapons.


Swordsmen
---------
Swordsmen wear full chain mail and helmets, and they carry swords and shields.
These are your elite fighters, chosen from among your strongest citizens. They
move reasonably well and are deadly hand-tohand fighters. Their armor and
weapons make them good at both attacking and defending at close range, and they
stand up pretty well to archer attacks. Sword production requires much iron and
some wood.


Knights
-------
Knights are the most powerful and most expensive close-range fighters. They 
wear heavy plate mail and carry swords and shields, but because they are 
mounted they are by far the fastest troops on the field. Their hand-to-hand
attack and defense abilities are the highest of any troops, and they withstand
archer attacks better than anyone. A knight's only weakness is his
vulnerability to crossbow attacks. 

To outfit knights requires large quantities of iron and small quantities of
wood.

Armies in the Realm
*******************
After you create an army in the armory, you will return to the main map, where
your new army stands awaiting orders. An army is represented by one or more
figures carrying a flag of its player's color. An army's size is reflected by
the number of figures that represent it on the main map. A one-figure army is
small, a two-figure army is medium sized, and a three-figure army is large.

Army Information
----------------
To get information about any army on the main map, right click on it. A panel
will display information about that army.

The three buttons at the bottom of the panel allow you to move, disband or
split the army. Clicking the move button closes the panel and readies the army
for movement on the main map.

When you right-click on another player's army, a small parchment panel displays
very general information about that army.


Moving Armies 
=============
To move an army, you may use the move button as
described above, or you may left-click directly on the
army on the main map. The mouse pointer will
change shape. As you move the pointer in the direction
you want the army to travel, a path will progress
in that direction, beginning from where the army currently
stands. Click on a destination to move the
army.

Each army has a certain number of movement points
each turn, which represents the distance the army is
able to travel during one season.

The number inside each ball shows the number of
movement points it costs to move across the terrain
your mouse pointer indicates. Youll notice that travel
across roads uses far fewer points than travel across
grass or fields. Armies may move across many types
of terrain, but they are fastest on roads.

Splitting armies and fighting battles also use movement
points.


Combining Armies
================
To combine two of your armies, move one army on
top of another. The first army will march over and
combine with the second.

Whenever you want to add forces to an army, this is
the way to do it. If, for example, you purchase 50
pikes and would like to give them to an existing army,
simply create a new army of 50 pikemen and combine
it with the existing army.

You may not combine two armies if they both contain
mercenaries.


Splitting an Army
=================
If you want to split one army into two smaller ones,
right-click on the army to bring up the army information
panel, then click on the Split Army button at
the bottom of the panel. A new panel appears that
gives a breakdown of units that comprise the army.

Use the left and right arrows to divide men between
the existing army and the new one. When you are satisfied
with the division, click on the thumbs up
gauntlet and the two new armies will appear on the
main map. If you decide you dont want to split the
army, click on the thumbs down gauntlet and the
army will remain as it was. Remember: an army must
have at least 50 soldiers in it.

Disbanding an Army
==================

To disband an army, right-click on it to bring up the
army information panel, then click on the Disband
Army button at the bottom of the panel. You will be
prompted to confirm your command.

The soldiers of a disbanded army will return to their
county of origin and become a part of the population
again. Their weapons will return to your treasury.


Pillaging
=========
Destroying your opponents resources can be an
effective, if barbaric, tactic. You may wage economic
warfare by destroying any opponents active fields or
industrial sites. To do so, simply march an army over
the site youd like to pillage.

When you attack a grain or cattle field, your soldiers
render the field barren and destroy all its contents.
When you attack any industrial site, it must shut
down for several seasons for repairs. You may also
attack a countys villages and slaughter its people,
which reduces the countys population.


Capturing Counties
==================
To conquer any neutral county (even one with a castle),
you must send an army to capture its countytown.
(Neutral counties appear green on the
overview map).

To conquer a county with a garrisoned castle (which
will always be controlled by a noble), you must capture
its castle.

To conquer a noble controlled county with no castle,
you must capture its county town. Human players
must defend their county towns by placing armies
nearby.

When you set the path of your army to end on an
enemy town or castle, the graphic representing the
armys last move will appear different.
Counties without castles tend to be much easier to
conquer than counties with castles.

The only way to capture a completed, garrisoned castle
is by laying siege. During a siege, your army surrounds
the defenders castle and builds special siege
weapons. As soon as these siege weapons are completed,
the battle will begin.

If your forces defeat the castle defenders and capture
the castle, it and its county will be yours another
jewel in your royal collection.

See Sieges on page 86 for more information.
When a neutral county has a castle, you will not need
to siege the castle to capture the town. Neutral counties
with castles will always be counties that have
revolted and kicked their ruling noble out. In these
counties, the castle has been abandoned.

Foraging
========
By default, the Army Foraging option (under the
Options/Advanced menu) is set to No. As long as foraging
is off, you will never have to worry about feeding
your armies; they will take care of themselves.
Any and all food management you do will be for your
civilian population.

For a more challenging game experience, switch Army
Foraging to Yes. See Army Foraging in the Advanced
Game Options section of this manual, page 106.
