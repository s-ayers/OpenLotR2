Battles
#######
The path to the throne will almost certainly be a
bloody one. Those who would dare to deny your
right to rule must face your wrath on the battlefield.
Open ground (non-siege) combat begins immediately
when:

*  One army attacks another or the paths of two opposing armies cross.
*  An army attacks the county town of a neutral or computer controlled county. 
   (When an army attacks a castle, combat occurs only after a siege, see page
   86).

Before combat begins, a panel will inform you of the
impending bloodbath, display the comparative troop
numbers of both forces, and ask you if you would
like to take the field.

If you choose not to take the field, the battle will be
calculated automatically. You may want to do this if,
after viewing the size and makeup of each army, you
believe either winning or losing is a foregone conclusion.
You never have to the take the field if you dont want
to, but when you decline you waive the opportunity
to use your tactical wizardry to your advantage. With
some practice, you may be able to defeat forces much
larger than your own!

To take command of the battle, click on the thumbs
up gauntlet and the engagement will begin.

Taking Command
**************
When the battle begins, you will see a top-down view
of the battlefield. Your main screen view shows a portion
of the field. Consult the overview map in the
upper right corner for a birds eye view of the entire
field. You may scroll your main view around just as
you do on the main map screen. You may also jump
to a new location by clicking on the overview map
while no units are selected.

The main screen will show the various terrain features
of the battlefield: rocks, rivers, bridges, forests, etc.
The troops of both sides will also be visible: attacking
army at the south (bottom) end, and defending army
at the north (top).

Each soldier figure wears the color of its kingdom
(the soldiers of neutral counties wear brown). Each
figure represents a unit of a certain type.


Ordering Units
--------------
To Select a Single Unit
To select a single unit, click directly on it. When a
unit is selected, a status bar will appear next to its figure
on the battlefield, and a symbol will appear in the
control panel.
To Select a Group of Units
To select a group of units, click and drag a rectangle
around the units you would like to select. A status
bar will appear next to each selected unit, and an icon
for each selected unit will appear in the control panel.
To Deselect a Single Unit
To deselect a single unit, click on the units icon on
the control panel (or select another unit).
To Deselect a Multiple Units
To deselect multiple units, right click on any empty
space on the battlefield (or select something else).
To Move a Selected Unit or Units
To move a selected unit (or units), click on a destination
on the battlefield, or on the overview map. All
selected men will move to the indicated spot.

To Order an Attack
To order a selected unit (or units) to attack, place
your mouse pointer over an enemy unit so that its
appearance changes, and click. Archers and crossbowmen
will be able to fire from a distance, all other
units are hand-to-hand units which must attack at
point blank range.

Unit Size
---------
Each soldier figure on the battlefield represents a unit. Unit size will vary
from battle to battle, depending on the overall size of the forces involved. In
one battle, a unit may be four men, in another it may be 16 men.

The status bar that accompanies each selected unit shows the number of men that
unit currently has, relative to the battles unit size. The icon that appears
in the control panel for each selected unit shows the actual number of soldiers
in that unit.

For example: picture two selected archer units, one with a fully green status
bar, and one with a half red/half green status bar. The icons in the control
panel indicate that the fully green unit contains eight archers, while the half
red unit contains four archers.

You now know that, in that particular battle, a unit consists of eight men.
When you select an enemy unit, you can guess how many men it contains by
looking at the status bar: if it is fully green, it probably contains eight 
men; if it shows a bit of red, it may contain six or seven men.

By looking at the number of figures on the field, and the status bars of each
unit figure, you can get a pretty good idea of the relative sizes of the
opposing forces.

The precise size of each army is shown above the appropriate shield at the
bottom of the control panel.

You may, for example, see that the number of figures on each side is about the
same. But if all of your figures have a status bar that is half red, and the
enemy's are all fully green, you will know that are outnumbered two to one (or 
thereabouts).

When a unit's status bar is completely red, it contains no men, and is wiped
out.

Battlefield Controls
--------------------
**Pause:** Starts and pauses the battle. When a battle begins, it will be
paused. To begin the battle, click on the hourglass button. You may pause the
battle at any time by clicking this button again. You may select units, but not
move them, when the battle is paused.

**Retreat:** Click on this button to order all your men to retreat from the
field. When you do so, your army will not escape without casualties but it will
escape complete annihilation. You may want to give this order if you are far
out numbered at least part of your army will survive to fight another day!

**Lower Castle Drawbridge:** This command will only work when you are defending
a castle with a drawbridge during a siege battle. Lowering the drawbridge will
allow your men to exit and enter the castle, but it will also allow the enemy
to get in if your leave the entrance undefended.

**Mop-up:** This button gives a general order to your army to attack and engage
the nearest enemy. You may want to issue this command after you have positioned
your troops effectively for an all out attack, or when the battle is nearly
decided and you wish to end it quickly and easily.

**Autocalculate:** Calculates the battle automatically. Choose this option if
you do not wish to command the battle.

Advanced Commands
-----------------
Advanced players may use the keyboard to issue advanced commands to troops. You
may, for example, assign multiple units to groups that will answer commands 
together. To create a command group, select all the units you would like to
group together, and hold down the control key while pressing any number key
from 1 to 9. Hitting that number key by itself at any time during the remainder
of the battle will select that group of units. You may then command all units
at once.

You may also order multiple units into formation. Press the Hkey to order the
selected units into a horizontal line. Press the V key to order selected units
into a vertical line.


Combat
------
Before you begin a battle, survey your army and devise a strategy. Consider the
size of your army, its composition, the battlefield terrain, and other features
such as rivers or bridges.

Once a unit is engaged, it will remain so until it annihilates the opposing
unit, it is annihilated itself, or you command it to disengage.

Figures will fall dead on the battlefield as units are killed off. The number
of remaining soldiers for each army appears on the control panel. Watch the
numbers fall to evaluate the battle in progress. An army wins a battle when one
of two things happens:

#.  It kills all the soldiers in the other army.
#.  The other army retreats.

When a battle ends, a panel will show the new unit breakdown of each army. Even
victories can be costly if a large portion of your army is killed. Click on the
exit arrow at the bottom right of the panel (or right click) to return to the
main map. If the losing army was destroyed in the battle, only the winner will
remain on the map.

If the battle has won a new county for the victor, a flag with the winner's
color will appear over the newly won county town.

Peasant Revolts
---------------
In addition to battling with rival armies, your troops may at times be called
upon to put down peasant uprisings.

When any county's happiness rating drops below 25 and stays there for more than
four seasons, its population will revolt. The ruling noble will be stripped of
power and a band of brigands will set out in search of food.

Peasant revolts will appear on the main map as torch carrying figures. They
will reduce the happiness of any county they wander into.

To put down a revolt, send one of your armies to attack the band of rebels just
as you would attack another army. The battle will play out as usual. You should
do your best to ensure that your counties do not revolt. Are your people
getting enough food? Are they healthy? Have you set taxes or conscription too
high?
