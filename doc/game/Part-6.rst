Sieges
######
A siege is a prolonged confrontation in which an invading army surrounds an
enemy castle and spends several seasons building siege weapons. Capturing a 
castle by siege is the only way to win a county that has a garrisoned castle.

Historically, Medieval armies besieging a castle had to contend with moats,
10-foot-thick stone walls, arrows, boiling oil, and other dangerous objects
being hurled at them by the castle defenders above. You will face these same
obstacles as you command sieges.

Once the siege battle begins, it will proceed just as a normal battle; you will
issue orders in the same fashion. During a siege battle, however, you will have
specialized weapons (catapults, battering rams, and siege towers) at your
disposal. To win a siege, you must do one of two things:

*  Kill all the soldiers defending the castle,



*  Break into the castle and capture its flag. A castle's flag will be clearly
   visible in the castle, in the color of the defenders kingdom. If one of
   your men reaches it, the castle is yours.

Laying Siege
************
The height and protection of a castle give its defenders a great advantage over
an attacking army. The advantage becomes greater the larger and more complex 
the castle is. Taking an enemy castle requires planning, manpower and
perseverance.

To begin a siege, select an army and move it to the castle you desire. With the
army selected, place the mouse pointer directly over the castle, so that the
movement indicator turns gold, and click.

Preparing a Siege
=================
When you begin a siege, a panel will allow you to prepare the siege by choosing
the type and number of siege weapons (catapults, battering rams and siege 
towers) you want to build.



Click on the up and down arrows to the left of each siege weapon to select how
many to build. The panel tells you how many seasons it will take to prepare for
the siegein other words, how long it will take your army to build the siege
weapons. The bigger your army, the less time it will take to build each weapon.


When you are satisfied with your selection of siege weapons, click the Proceed
button.

While your siege weapons are being built, a symbol will appear over the
besieged castle showing the number of remaining seasons of siege preparation.
Click on the besieging army to monitor its progress.

When the siege battle is about to begin, a panel will inform you that the siege
battle is about to begin. The panel lists the breakdown of units for each army
and asks you if youd like to take the field. If you choose not to, the
computer will immediately calculate the results of the siege battle.

The Siege Screen
================
If you choose to take the field, the battlefield screen will appear, with the
castle dominating the landscape. The siege weapons you have built will be
present. Your army, complete with siege weapons, awaits orders outside the
entrance of the castleor on the opposite side of the moat if there is one. The
garrison defending the castle is stationed inside. Survey the positions of both
your army and the castle's defenders before the siege begins so you can devise
your attack strategy.


Winning a Siege
===============
Offensively, there are two ways to win a siege.
One is by killing all the castle defenders. Archers, firing
from outside the castle, will help you accomplish
this, but you will most often have to send soldiers
into the castle to fight hand-to-hand.
The other way is by capturing the castles flag. To do
this, you must break into the castle in some way and
at least one soldier must reach the flag, which will be
clearly visible in the main screen view. The area surrounding
the enemys flag will often be guarded heavily.
There are several ways to get into a castle: you can
 Use a siege tower to climb over the wall.
 Punch holes in the wall with a catapult.
 Destroy a gate with a battering ram.
 Have your soldiers hack the gate to pieces. (This
will not work on Drawbridges).
ONLY castle wallsnot towersmay be knocked
down or climbed.

Siege Weapons
=============
Siege weapons are catapults, battering rams, and siege
towers. When the siege battle begins, your siege
weapons will be on the field along with the rest of
your troops. Siege weapons do require soldiers to
man them. These soldiers will be represented in the
control panel when you select a weapon, but will not
be visible on the field. When you give an order to a
siege weapon, you are effectively ordering its crew.

While any siege weapon is within range of enemy
archers or crossbowmen, it is vulnerable to attack.
Siege weapons are especially vulnerable to crossbow
fire. Close range units can also be used to attack and
destroy siege weapons.

Once the entire crew manning the weapon is killed,
the weapon is destroyed and will disappear from the
field.


Catapults
---------
A catapult can knock down a castle wall from a distance,
including from across a moat. To use a catapult,
maneuver it to face the wall you want to attack. With
the catapult selected, move your mouse pointer over
the target spot on the wall and click. The catapult will
fire repeatedly until the wall is breached. Once this
happens, you may march your soldiers right through
the hole in the wall.


Battering Rams
--------------
A battering ram can knock down a castle gate. A battering
ram must be moved right against its target to
work. To use a battering ram, move it against the gate
you would like to attack so that its ram faces the gate.
The battering ram will pound on the gate until it is
breached. Your men will then be able to march
through the opening and into the castle.


Siege Towers
------------
A siege tower allows your soldiers to climb up and
over a castle wall. To use a siege tower, move it right
against the target wall. When the siege tower is in
place, it will open up automatically, signalling that it is
accessible. You may then march your troops over the
tower and into the castle.


Walls, Towers, and Gates
------------------------
Walls and towers will provide protection for a castles
garrison. Archers and crossbowmen may be positioned
along the top of a wall or atop a tower in order
to target attackers below.

Neither archers nor crossbowmen will be capable of
firing over a wall or tower from the ground level. This
means that those inside a castle must be on top of a
wall or tower to fire at those outside, and those outside
may only hit troops that are on top of a wall or
tower.

Troops atop walls or towers will be somewhat protected
from missile troops firing from below and will
endure fewer casualties than they would if they were
on the same level.

The various siege weapons must target areas of a castle
with care: battering rams may only attack castle
gates; catapults can only break through walls; and
siege towers will only work on walls.

Once inside a castle, the only way to move from walls
to higher towers is via stairways. Send your troops
through the stairways to move from level to level.

Defending troops may move in and out of gates at
will. Attackers must destroy a gate to go through it.


Moats
-----
A castle with a moat presents a special challenge. As
the attacker, you must fill in part of the moat in
order to enable your men to attack and enter the castle.
Any unit is capable of moat filling, with the exception
of knights.

Before ordering units to begin filling in the moat,
choose the section you would like to fill. It might be
the narrowest section of moat, or it might be the section
adjacent to the area youd like to attack.

To order units to fill in a section of moat, select the
units, and then click on the area of water you want to
fill in. The selected units will march to the edge of the
water with shovels and begin digging.

Your diggers will be open to attack while they are
working. You may find it best to use peasants for this
task, since you will eventually want to send your
skilled fighters into the castle.

One solid strategy is to fire a catapult over a moat to
breach a wall, and then send your troops over the
moat and through the breach.

Defending a Castle
******************
If you are defending against a castle siege, your goal is obvious: hold the
castle at all costs. The first step is to create a large and powerful garrison,
complete with archers and crossbowmen to pick off attackers before they can
reach you. As defender, the advantage is yours and you must exploit it to its
fullest! Remember: if the attacker gets to your flag, the castle is lost guard
it well!



Boiling Oil
===========
Along with missile troops, another effective weapon
for castle defense is boiling oil. Each castle will be
automatically supplied with one or more cauldrons of
boiling oil. Boiling oil is very effective when dumped
on troops and siege weapons who get too close to
your castle walls.

Move and dump your cauldrons just as you move
attack with your troops. The effects of a boiling oil
attack can be spectacular and deadly.



Defending the Flag
==================
Remember: a castle siege can be a game of capture the
flag. If an attacker reaches your flag, the castle is lost.
You must make sure your flag is well defended on all
sides. Keep a close eye on your flag and dont let your
opponent sneak up on your from behind.




The Drawbridge
==============
Castles that have moats will also have drawbridges, which you may open by using
the lower castle drawbridge button. You may want to lower the drawbridge in
order to send hand-to-hand combat troops out of your castle to destroy siege
weapons. Once you open a drawbridge, your troops may move in and out of the 
castle but so can the enemy. Make sure your drawbridge is well guarded while it
is open.


***********
The Outcome
***********
If you have won the siege, the contested county is now yours and you'll see a
flag bearing your game colors flying atop the castle when you return to the
main screen.

If the castle is damaged, set about repairing it as soon as you have the
materials and builders. (See Repairing a Castle.) Damage will carry over from
siege to siege unless you repair it.
