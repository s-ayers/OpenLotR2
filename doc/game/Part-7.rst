Diplomacy
#########
Even in the 13th century, government was as much
about political backscratchingnot to mention back
stabbingthan the ability to lead. The balance of
power is often a delicate matter that rests precariously
upon loyalties, betrayals, favors, and deceits.

You are but one of many seeking the throne. How
you interact with the others is entirely up to you.
Will you make alliances and remain loyal to your
friends? Will you lie and doublecross, bringing ruin
to those hapless souls who trusted you? Or will you
be a lone wolf, shunning diplomacy altogether? The
choice is yours.

As you play, you will get to know your opponents
well. Study their words and actionshistorys great
leaders often display an uncanny ability to read the
minds of their enemies.

The Players
***********

The Knight
==========
What he lacks in maturity, patience, and tact, the
Knight makes up for in daring. He is zealous and
cocksure, he and loves nothing more than to show off
his prowess on the battlefield.

The Knight favors lightning strikes and invasions,
often taking weaker opponents by complete surprise
early on. He has been known to work his peasantry
to the point of cruelty in order to produce and support
his ruffian armies.

The Knight is a would-be warrior king, but he is no
statesman. His road to the throne lies on the battlefield,
not in the negotiating chambers.
His demeanor is rough, power-hungry, and basebut
his sword is always polished.


The Countess
============
Her trail is strewn with the ruined souls of all who
have underestimated her. The Countess is a master of
diplomacy, but her lust for power will always win out
over honesty or loyalty. She will treat her friends with
grace and respectuntil she no longer has use for
them.

Highly intelligent, eloquent, and well-schooled, the
Countess has no doubt that she is destined to rule all,
and she has yet to meet an adversary she could not
ruin with ease.

Beware of the Countess. Her mien is regal and her
countenance is fair, but her tactics are cruel and her
terrible resolve will not be denied.
Ally yourself with her at your own risk.


The Bishop
==========
Do not expect the Bishop to bow easily he has God
on his side. Cloistered in his clerical fortress, he and
his Council of Elders plot endlessly to further the
cause of the Churchnot to mention their own
wealth, power, and prestige.

The Bishop wields enormous influence with his infinitely
loyal following, but he tends to hide behind the
altar as soon as trouble breaks.

The Bishop will be bold, pompous, and mocking
when he is on top, but cowardly and grovelling when
he is cornered.

Don't be fooled by his pious prattle. His Grace covets
but one sacrament the crown.


The Baron
=========
The Baron is the elder statesman of the group. His
years of experience have taught him that order arises
from cold calculation rather than passion or empathy.
The Baron believes he is the only soul who possesses
the maturity and discipline to be King. He will take
no pleasure in crushing his opponentsno, hell do it
simply because it is necessary to secure his ascension
to the throne.

His rule is solid and practical, but his detachment
makes him unyielding and severe. He has a strong
sense of dignity and deals swiftly with those who
would challenge it.

His realm is ruled by a hard and oppressive brand of
justice. His people are obedient, but they live in fear.

Messages
********
Your relationships with the other players will develop
through an ongoing exchange of messages.

To send a message, click on the Diplomacy button on
the control panel. The diplomacy panel will appear.

Sending Messages
================
Each turn you may send one message to each of the other players. To send a
message, click on the portrait of the intended recipient. A highlight will
frame the selected player and the message options on the right will display all
your message options for that player.

Select the type of message you would like to send. A panel will appear,
containing a suggested message of that type. You may keep the default message,
or you may type in your own message. Click on the thumbs up gauntlet to
dispatch the message. It will arrive at its destination, and you should receive
a response shortly thereafter.

In multiplayer games, human players receive messages instantly.

Sending Gifts
=============
You may send a monetary gift to another player by
selecting Dispatch Gift from the message panel. A gift
can boost your standing in the eyes of its recipient.
When you select this option from the message panel,
a second panel will appear. Use the up and down
arrows to set the amount of your gift. Then click on
the thumbs up gauntlet to dispatch the gift.


Compliments and Insults
=======================
Compliments provide a free way to gain favor with
selected opponents. You may want to send compliments
to players who are especially powerful, who
pose a danger to you, or whose services might be
valuable later on.

Be careful not to compliment too frequently, though.
Excess in this area can be a transparent attempt to
manipulate. Your opponents (for the most part)are
not stupid. Too many kind words can work against
you in the long run.

An insult is likely to hurt your relationship with the
recipient. Sending insults is a good way to let an
enemy know exactly how you feel.

Friend or Foe?
==============
The message panel displays a picture of each opponent remaining in the game.
The colored bar next to each portrait shows the current state of your
relationship with that player. A higher bar reflects a friendlier relationship;
a lower bar reflects a more hostile relationship. The color of the bar will
also reflect the nature of the relationship (red=hostile, blue=indifferent,
green=friendly).

If you anger an opponent badly enough, he or she will become an enemy. A symbol
will appear next to each opponent you have so offended. Once an opponent 
reaches enemy status, he or she will remain so for the rest of the game. Enemy
status represents an irreparable breach between two players.

The higher an opponent's opinion of you, the less likely he or she is to attack
you, or to refuse an alliance should you request one. As favor drops, an 
opponent is more likely to attack or to refuse a friendly overture.

To improve your relationships, you may send compliments and gifts. To aid your 
quest for the crown, you may choose to
form alliances with your opponents. You may initiate
an alliance with another player by choosing Offer an
Alliance from the message panel. The player may or
may not accept your offer. Likewise, another player
may offer you an alliance. Accept or reject it as you
will, but choose your friends wisely! Make and break
alliances to your advantage, and remember: in the end
there is only one winner.

An alliance gives you options you do not have when
you go it alone. When you select an ally on the message
panel, additional message options will appear.
You may :

Terminate your alliance: Once an alliance benefits you no more, you should
terminate it. Terminating an alliance is the honorable way to say farewell.


Ask ally for help: If one of your counties is under
attack, you may ask an ally to send troops to your aid.
This request come in especially handy if you are the
target of a siege.

Ask ally to attack: You may also ask an ally to attack
another county. When you select this option, a small
map will appear, allowing you to choose your target.

You always have the option to doublecross your
allies, but this is not a wise course of action. When
you attack an ally without terminating your alliance,
all other players will be hesitant to trust you in the
future. All will be more willing to attack you and less
willing to form alliances with you.

A safer route is to simply terminate an alliance you
no longer need, and then launch your attack.
