Advanced Play
#############
By default, LORDS OF THE REALM II is designed for easy play. There are, 
however, several advanced options that experienced players may try when they 
feel they are ready for a special challenge.


****************
Advanced Farming
****************
When Advanced Farming is activated, you will have to pay more attention to your
grain fields (if you have any).

Labor: The number of laborers required to get the most out of your grain
farming will fluctuate from season to season, according to the grain planting 
cycle. Each grain field will require relatively few workers during the spring
and summer. During the fall you will need a great many grain workers to tend to
the harvest, and during the winter you will need quite a few to get the fields
ready for next season's planting.

**Weather:** Advanced Farming also introduces weather as an influence upon your
grain fields. Each season's weather has the potential to affect your grain
output. Many seasons will be cloudy and mild, having no great effect on your
output. But droughts can severely undercut your efforts, and can reduce your
grain productivity. Sunny seasons, on the other hand, can improve your harvest.

While Advanced Farming is active, a weather report is available each season on
the Advanced Labor panel (accessed by clicking on your county towns).

**Fertility:** Fertility also becomes a factor under Advanced Farming. In order
to keep your fields fertile, you will need to leave a portion of them fallow at
all times. While Advanced Farming is on, you should try to keep at least a
third of your fields fallow. The more fallow fields you have, the more fertile
your active fields are likely to be. You do not have to engage actively in any
sort of crop rotation just make sure a portion of your fields remain fallow.


A fertility report beneath the weather report on the Advanced Labor panel will
keep you abreast of each county's fertility. When fertility is high, grain
output will be high. When fertility is poor, grain output will suffer.


*************
Army Foraging
*************
Under the default play settings you will never have to worry about feeding
armies. Once you draft a peasant he will no longer eat, as far as you are
concerned. Your ration management applies exclusively to your civilian
population.


With Army Foraging switched on, this is no longer the case. Each army must now
survive on the food available in the county it occupies. Armies will 
automatically consume food in the county they are in, and they will eat before
the county's population. So, if you march an army through a county with meager
food supplies, its population may suffer.

As long as any army is in a county you control, you will need to provide
rations for it. This is done, as usual, through the rations panel.

While Army Foraging is active, the ration panel will keep you informed of how
many soldiers are foraging in each county.

In addition to feeding your own soldiers, this advanced option requires you to
feed the soldiers of any other player, friend or foe, as long as they are in a
county you control.

If the troops are friendly, you must feed them as a courtesy. If they are
hostile, they will raid your county's stores and help themselves to your food.


***********
Exploration
***********
Exploration offers a more realistic game experience by obscuring your vision of
the kingdom map. During the Middle Ages, leaders seldom knew for certain what
their adversaries were doing, or even what the landscape outside their homeland
looked like.

While Exploration is turned on, your vision of the kingdom map will be limited
to what you have explored. When the game begins, you will only be able to see
the single county you control. The rest of the map will be blacked out.

To expand your vision, you must explore the land. As your armies travel, the
areas around them will be revealed to you gradually. Only when you have 
explored the entire region will you see all the lands you seek to rule.


************
Custom Games
************
You may customize any single player or multiplayer game. To do so, select
Custom Game from the startup screen before you begin.

The custom game panel will allow you to set the options that you can normally
set: difficulty, advanced farming, army foraging, and exploration. But here you
have many more options.

If you would like to begin combat right away, all players can start with a
castle, weapons, and an army. You may decide how many nobles will vie for the
crown, and you may set the amount of gold (crowns) each players starts with.

There are a number of mapsÂ—both real and fictional to choose from. Each offers
a unique strategic challenge.

Advanced Farming, see page 106.

Exploration, see page 108.

Nobles allows you to determine how many nobles will compete for the throne. In
multiplayer games, all positions not filled by human players will be filled by
computer controlled nobles.

Army Foraging, see page 107.

The Difficulty setting will determining how challenging the game will be.

Army size determines how large an army (if any) all the players will begin
with.

Starting castle determines how large a castle (if any) each player begins with.

County Status refers to how strong or weak each player's starting county will
be. It takes into account the population, number of fields, number of cows,
happiness, and health that each player will begin the game with.

Time Limit is designed primarily for multiplayer games. It sets a maximum time
limit that each turn can last. If each player does not end his or her turn 
before the time allotment has passed, the turn will end automatically. During
games with time limits, the timer will be visible onscreen at all times.


The Fight option allows you to set the game to automatically calculate each
battle fought against a nonhuman opponent. This feature is designed for
multiplayer games. If Humans is set, every battle that is fought against a
non-human opponent will immediately be calculated automatically. Only battles
against other human players will be fought manually. When All is set, every
battle will be fought manually.
