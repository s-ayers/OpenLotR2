#.  **England:** Balanced for 2-5 players, this is the standard game map. All
    starting counties have about the same number of fields. Two counties have
    the advantage of having islands that can't be pillaged. The best counties
    to hold here are on the western side of the country because limited access
    makes them more defensible.

#.  **Scotland:** This is a small map for up to 5 players. With only 10
    counties, some of which have very limited resources, life here is
    appropriately nasty, brutish and short. Strategically, this map is a figure
    8 even though cross-country movement is necessary to cut across the center.
    The key counties to hold are the ones in the center of the map which divide
    the country in half.

#.  **Ireland:** Balanced for a 4 player game, a fifth player will have to 
    fight for space. Each starting county is adjacent to two neutral counties.
    However, all of the neutral counties can be easily reached from at least
    two starting counties. The fifth player starts in the middle and must fight
    his way out. Try to gain control of the neutral counties on either side of
    your starting location and avoid early wars.

#.  **France:** Smaller than modern day France, the northern and eastern parts
    of the country were controlled by the Holy Roman Empire. Designed as a 5
    player map, each player has access to two neutral counties which will 
    provide all resources and act as a base from which to seek the throne.
    Starting in the Royal Demesne is most challenging because it is surrounded
    by enemies. However, it also has the best access to neutral counties.

#.  **Germany:** This is the Holy Roman Empire and includes territory in modern
    France, Italy, Austria, etc. The inner ring of counties contains all of the
    important crossroads and enables access to the outer counties, like spokes
    on a wheel. The outer counties contain the best resources but have the 
    least access to 118 other counties and see very few merchants.

#.  **Italy:** As a peninsula, this country imposes a linear strategy: fight
    from one end to the other. If you are unfortunate enough to start in the
    center, head either north or south while maintaining friendly relations 
    with the players facing your other border. Avoid fighting on both fronts
    simultaneously.

#.  **Europe:** Best for 2-5 players, this map will always provide an 
    interesting game. Many of the neutral counties here can only be reached by
    passing through enemy territory. Defend your home county well and gain
    control of any neutral counties in your rear areas. France and Germany, in
    the center of the map, will be hard pressed to avoid an early demise.

#.  **Crusades:** Many counties divide this crescent shaped map in half. You
    will be fighting from one end to the other. Regardless of where you start,
    secure the counties in either Greece or Africa first and then turn back and
    fight for the center. Don't allow players with a single front to remain at
    peace for too long.

#.  **Africa:** This is an outstanding map for any number of players. French
    North Africa is by far the most strategically important county because it
    contains four other counties within it. However, it is also one of the most
    difficult to hold on to, especially with army foraging on. It has few 
    fields which are inconveniently spread out and easily pillaged. Once you 
    gain control of this county, make an effort to build a strong castle and,
    with foraging on, immediately start shipping food in. If an opponent
    controls it, make every effort to either capture it or make it revolt: his
    remaining counties will be non-contiguous and will turn neutral.

#.  **India:** This is an interesting medium sized map for up to 5 players. The
    northern counties have an abundance of fields but no resources. The
    counties above them have resources but few fields. The central locations
    are well placed to start in but are inconvenient to capture. To conquer the
    western side of the map, you must capture a county accessed from the east
    and vice versa. Starting in the south is probably safest.

#.  **China:** Using the province borders of the Northern Sung dynasty and a
    road network based on the main trade routes of the period, this map is
    historically accurate. Each starting area has access to at least two 
    neutral counties which provide the necessary resources to form a solid 
    base. Pay attention to the strategic possibilities of off-road movement.
    Unlike other maps, there are no rear areas that can be easily defended.
    Every county can be invaded from at least two others. Ching His-Tung
    county, the capital, is similar to the Royal Demesne on the France map: it
    is centrally located and surrounded by enemies but also has the best access
    to neutral counties.

#.  **Jigsaw:** This fictional map is exceptionally well balanced for 2 or 4
    players. Adding a 5th will make it very bloody (and challenging for the 5th
    player). Each player can control three counties as a base and then fight
    for control of the center. Once you own the center, defend it well and then
    expand into another quadrant. If an enemy controls the center, make sure he
    doesn't hold it for long.

#.  **Rose:** This small fictional map for 2-5 players works best with 5. Each
    player has only his home county and access to the central county. However,
    since the home counties are adjacent to one another it is not necessary to
    hold the central county to increase the size of your domain. With such a
    small map, plan a quick conquest rather than a long campaign. Starting with
    strong castles will lengthen the game somewhat.

#.  **Bullseye:** Two concentric rings of counties with three concentric rings
    of roads makes this an entertaining geometric map. Evenly balanced for 2 or
    4 players, with the 5th player appearing in the middle, this map always
    provides a lively, entertaining game. Control of the central county will
    allow conquest of territories on opposite sides of the map. It will also
    allow conquest of counties that divide an opponent's territory in half.

#.  **Crossroads:** Another evenly balanced 2 or 4 player map with the 5th
    player in the center. Here, 120 control of the center is essential because
    it separates each of the other counties. If you can't control the center,
    try pillaging your opponents. Eliminating other players by making their
    counties revolt is almost as good as conquering the county.

#.  **Rorschak:** Spend a few moments studying this map before playing it. The
    northwest and southeast are easiest to hold but are difficult to expand
    from. The northeastern counties are interconnected and will probably form
    the largest initial kingdom. The southwestern counties are actually the
    strategic center of the map and the most dangerous area to start in.

#.  **Centreville:** This is a medium sized fictional map with seven counties
    forming an arc around a central county. In a 4 or 5 player game, there will
    be a scramble for neutral counties, as there aren't enough to go around.
    The central county is, of course, the most important and with five players
    someone will have the difficult task of defending it.

#.  **Quaintville:** Very small 2-4 player map. The center is not nearly as
    important here as on other maps of this type. All counties are adjacent to
    all other counties so it is impossible to divide a kingdom in two. Also,
    since the center is so inaccessible, it is faster to move around it than
    through it.

#.  **Pretzelland:** Specifically designed for 5 players, each player will have
    two natural enemies. However, with nearly all counties contiguous, it is
    possible to fight anyone and still be able to retain most captured 
    counties. Note that some counties are adjacent even though it is not
    possible to move between them.

#.  **New England:** Massachusetts is the key to victory on this map. Without
    it you won't be able to control more than half of the map. This small map
    will be quick and bloody with any number of players.

#.  **Equalizer:** This is a perfectly balanced 2 or 4 player map. All players
    have equal resources and access to all other players. Be careful to defend
    against all opponents: diagonally opposed counties are not contiguous but a
    surprise attack can cost you your home base even if the conqueror can't
    retain his prize.

#.  **Rubix World:** Also perfectly balanced for 2 or 4 players, this is a
    medium sized map which will take slightly longer to play. Note that
    counties which are diagonally adjacent are not contiguous. There are 
    limited resources here: if you canÂ’t capture counties containing iron and
    stone you will have to purchase them.

#.  **Pentagon:** This is a perfectly balanced "donut shaped" 5 player map.
    Each county is contiguous only with its nearest neighbors. Try to form an
    alliance with a player on the opposite side of the map and get him to
    attack the county adjacent to both of you. You can join in this attack when
    your other border is at peace (let your ally do the fighting while you 
    retain the county). If at war with your other neighbor, you will be able to
    concentrate on him as long as your ally can protect your rear.

#.  **YinYang:** Balanced for 2, 3 or 5 players, this medium sized map does not
    have enough neutral counties for everyone. There are plenty of resources 
    for weapons, but stone is in short supply.
